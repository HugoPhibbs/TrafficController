# Project Manifesto

## Testing
- Unit testing will be performed using unittest
- Create unit tests for each of the classes involved, along with any other supporting methods
- This should be done in a comprehensive manner, but not in a way that wastes time
- Aim for 100% test coverage

## Programming language
- Using python throughout this project. Done so because I haven't done actual software engineering with Python, only Java and TypeScript

## Conventions
- Naming conventions follow standard python snake case style

## Documentation
- Code should be documented througout. 
- All methods, classes and class attributes should have documentation, along with any necessary comments

## Project Management
- This will be done using Asana to track and record progress
- A kanban board will be used
- Good idea to breakdown everything that needs to be done using a WBS
